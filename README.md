# üìå Sudoku Solver
This project is a **C++ based Sudoku Solver** that uses **backtracking** to solve a standard 9√ó9 Sudoku puzzle. The program provides an interactive interface for the user to input the Sudoku puzzle and then applies recursive backtracking to compute the solution.

## ‚ú® Features
### 1.Two Input Modes
- Manual Input: Enter Sudoku values cell-by-cell through the console. Empty cells are represented by 0.
- File Input: Provide a text file containing all 81 values separated by spaces. Empty cells should be written as 0.

### 2.Grid Representation
- The Sudoku grid is stored internally as a 9x9 integer array.
- Values are displayed in a formatted grid with clear separators for 3√ó3 sub-grids.

### 3.Validation Checks
- Ensures that numbers follow Sudoku rules:
  - Each row must contain unique values (1‚Äì9).
  - Each column must contain unique values.
  - Each 3√ó3 sub-grid must contain unique values.
- Input values are checked for correctness (0‚Äì9 range).

### 4.Backtracking Algorithm
- Uses recursion to try possible values for empty cells.
- If a chosen number violates Sudoku rules, it backtracks and tries another value.
- This continues until the grid is completely solved or no solution is possible.

### 5.Statistics
- Tracks how many times the recursive singleCellSolve() function is called.
- Displays recursion count after solving, giving insight into computational effort.

### 6.User Feedback
- Prints intermediate messages like ‚ÄúCalculating possibilities...‚Äù and ‚ÄúBacktracking across puzzle...‚Äù.
- Informs whether the puzzle has been solved or if it has no valid solution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components
- ```SudokuGrid``` **Class**
  - Manages the Sudoku grid (input, storage, display, set/get cell values).
  - Provides options to input from console or file.
  - Handles formatting of the Sudoku board for better visualization.
- ```SudokuSolver``` **Class**
  - Implements the backtracking algorithm.
  - Contains methods for validating rows, columns, and 3√ó3 sub-grids.
  - Checks whether the grid is completely solved.
  - Calls recursive solving function until solution is found.

## üöÄ Working Flow
**1. Menu Prompt** ‚Üí User selects input method (manual/file).

**2. Input Puzzle** ‚Üí Sudoku grid is filled into memory.

**3. Initial Display** ‚Üí Shows the unsolved Sudoku grid.

**4. Solve Process** ‚Üí Recursive backtracking algorithm tries all valid possibilities.

**5. Final Display** ‚Üí Prints the solved Sudoku grid (if solvable).

**6. Statistics** ‚Üí Shows number of recursive calls used in solving.

## üìÇ Example File Input
A text file (```puzzle.txt```) with values:
```
5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0
0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9
```
Empty spaces are represented by ```0```.
